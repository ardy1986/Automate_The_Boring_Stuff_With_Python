# Automate_The_Boring_Stuff_With_Python

This is my notebook for the book Automate_the_Boring_Stuff_with_Python. You could access this book for free. Thanks for the author Al Sweigart, we could have this wonderful learning material for python beginners.

I hope this could help those people who study this book.

I haven't finish all practice projects. If you finish it, welcome to pull a request to add your solution.
